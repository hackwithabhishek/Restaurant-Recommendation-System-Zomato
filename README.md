### My motivation for using Zomato API
By Collecting the data using Zomato API one can recommend restaurants on the basis of user’s affinity to specific cuisines, establishment types, locations, and price bands.

We can find out whether restaurant support online reservation or not.

We can find what is the most popular and/ or exclusive/new at a given location & time.

## [Zomato cuisine problem](https://github.com/hackwithabhishek/Restaurant-Recommendation-System-Zomato/tree/main/Zomato%20cuisine%20problem)

Mexican cuisine began about 9,000 years ago, when agricultural communities such as the Maya formed, domesticating maize, creating the standard process of corn nixtamalization, and establishing their foodways.

You are a huge fan of ‘Mexican’ cuisine. Now using the Zomato API you want to analyse the best restaurant serving the Mexican Cuisine, their locations, and cost for two, etc.

There is a list of questions related to Mexican cuisines given in the next section.
